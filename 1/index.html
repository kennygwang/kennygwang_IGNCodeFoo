                    <h2>Step #1: Identify Assumptions.</h2>
                    <p>The purpose of doing a Fermi question is to demonstrate your approximation skills
                    and the importance of clearly identifying your assumptions.
                    Here, we will be making assumptions about the interior volume of the bus
                    and how the ping pong balls will fit inside it.
                    With the proper assumptions, our solution will be close to correct since our over- and
                    under-estimates will roughly cancel out. It will be acceptable to be
                    within one order of magnitude from the "true answer."</p>
                    <p>The biggest assumption I will be making is that we can consider the interior of
                    the bus to be a rectangular prism. This ignores several aspects of the bus's true geometry,
                    but allow me to explain how the over- and under- estimations cancel out.</p>
                    <p>First, assume we can ignore the details of the front of the bus, e.g. the driver's seat,
                    the space around the gas and brake pedals, the steering wheel, dashboard and equipment,
                    and the stairs. Ignoring things like the driver's seat or dashboard would effectively
                    "add space" by pretending that they don't exist, but ignoring the gas/break pedal space
                    and stairs would also then "remove space." Thus, we can think of the front of the bus in
                    a simplified manner.</p>
                    <p>Next, ignore the curvature of the bus roof. If we take height of the highest point of
                    the roof's arc to be the height of our rectangular prism, then we are overestimating the
                    volume of the bus. However, by ignoring the volume taken up by the bus seat support bars
                    and also the "humps" in the bus cabin that make room for the bus wheels, we roughly cancel
                    out our overestimate.</p>
                    <p>Essentially, all we need to know is the height, length, and width of our bus interior to
                    find the approximate volume.</p>

                    <h2>Step #2: Determine the dimensions of an average-sized school bus cabin.</h2>
                    <p>The average Type C school bus interior manufactured by Blue Bird Corporation is 90.75
                    inches wide, (since there was a range of lengths, I took the mean value) 394 inches long,
                    and 74 inches high.</p>
                    <p><strong>Volume: 90.75 x 394 x 74 = 2645907 cubic inches, or 43.36 cubic meters</strong></p>

                <li>
                    <h2>Step #3: Determine the total volume of bus seats.</h2>
                    <p>Something that should not be ignored is the space taken up by the bus seats. According
                    to the spec sheet, Blue Bird Type C buses have passenger capacities of 48 - 77 persons, but
                    let's assume we can take one of the middle values and say that the typical bus carries at
                    maximum 66 passengers. Since a maximum of 3 people are allowed per seat, that makes 22 bus
                    seats.</p>
                    <p>Finding documentation for the dimensions of school bus seats is difficult, but by
                    combining various sources we can come up with a reasonable estimate. Let's assume that seat
                    backs are 39 inches wide, 26.5 inches high, and 4.5 inches deep and that seat bottoms are 39
                    inches wide, 15 inches high, and 4.5 inches deep.</p>
                    <p><strong>Total Seat Volume: 22 x ( 39 x 26.5 x 4.5 + 39 x 15 x 4.5 ) =
                    160231.5 cubic inches, or 2.62572 cubic meters</strong></p>
                    <p>In order to find the total volume that ping pong balls may occupy on a bus, we subtract
                    the seat volume from the cabin volume:</p>
                    <p><strong>Net Volume: 43.36 - 2.62572 = 40.73428 cubic meters</strong></p>

                    <h2>Step #4: Determine the size of a ping pong ball.</h2>
                    <p>The diameter of a ping pong ball is 40 mm, or 0.04 meters. The volume of a ping pong
                    ball is thus:</p>
                    <p><strong>(4/3) * pi * .02^3 =  0.000033510 cubic meters</strong></p>

                <li>
                    <h2>Step #5: Consider the Close-Packing of Equal Spheres</h2>
                    <p>Since we are filling a cubic space with spherical objects, we cannot expect that
                    the entire volume will be filled-in since there will be gaps between adjacent ping pong
                    balls. In order to maximize the number of balls in a space, we wouldn't stack them in a
                    grid-like lattice, but rather offset the ping pong balls so that each balls rests upon the
                    empty space formed by the adjacent balls underneath it. Using the most efficient lattice,
                    Carl Friedrich Gauss proved that about 74.048 % of a space can be filled in by sphere
                    packing.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, the total amount of space that our ping pong balls will occupy is:</p>
                    <p><strong>0.74048 x 40.73428 = 30.16292 cubic meters</strong></p>

                <li>
                    <h2>Step #6: Final Calculation</h2>
                    <p>We found that the total volume that our ping pong balls can fill by the close-packing
                    of equal spheres in a bus cabin is 30.16292 cubic meters and that a ping pong ball is
                    0.000033510 cubic meters in volume. <strong>30.16292 / 0.000033510 = 900116.98</strong>,
                    and we can disregard the fraction since we are not interested in fractions of ping
                    pong balls.</p>
                    <p><strong>You could fit 900,116 ping pong balls in an average-sized school bus.</strong></p>
