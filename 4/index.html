                <p><h1>Bonus #1: Programmatically create a game of Connect 4 with one
                AI-controlled opponent and a human-controlled player.</h1>
                This is a game of Connect 4 made using the HTML Canvas element
                and Javascript. Click on one of the columns to drop in a piece.
                The human-controlled player is always the first to move. The
                AI-controlled opponent's moves are heuristically determined.
                Its first priority is to win and its second priority is to block
                human-controlled player wins. Otherwise, it moves depending on how
                many human-controlled player pieces surround a particular spot. It
                avoids moves that give the player a chance to win
                and also avoids moves that give the player a chance to block. It's
                not impossible to beat, but it does require the player to pay attention.
                The wins are recursively determined. The scoreboard below the game board
                uses jQuery.</p>
