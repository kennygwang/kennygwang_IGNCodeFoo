                <p><h1>Bonus: Programmatically create a game of Connect 4 with one
                AI-controlled opponent and a human-controlled player.</h1>
                This is a game of Connect 4 made using the HTML Canvas element
                and Javascript. The human-controlled player is always the first
                to move. The AI-controlled opponent heuristically determines
                its next move based on where the human-controlled player's
                pieces are, and tends to be more defensive. It's
                not impossible to beat, but just requires the player to pay a
                fair amount of attention. The wins are recursively checked for.</p>
